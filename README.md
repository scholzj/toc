# CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)

The CNCF TOC is the technical governing body of the CNCF Foundation. It admits and oversees all projects in the CNCF Foundation and has a mandate to facilitate driving neutral consensus for:
* defining and maintaining the technical vision for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation,
* approving new projects within the scope for CNCF set by the Governing Board (GB), and create a conceptual architecture for the projects,aligning projects, removing or archiving projects,
* accepting feedback from end user committee and map to projects,
* aligning interfaces to components under management (code reference implementations before standardizing), and defining common practices to be implemented across CNCF projects, if any.
